# ScentConnect: Bringing Love Closer Through Scent  

## Overview  
Long-distance relationships come with unique challengesâ€”missing your partnerâ€™s presence, longing for shared moments, and feeling the void of physical closeness. While technology enables visual and auditory communication, the sense of smell remains neglected.  

**ScentConnect** bridges this gap by allowing partners to send each other comforting scents in real-time. Using motion detection and wireless communication, this smart fragrance dispenser enhances emotional connection beyond screens.  

## How It Works  
ScentConnect consists of two identical devices, each with:  
- **Motion Detection**: Detects movement and triggers a signal to the partner's device.  
- **Scent Activation**: Dispenses a predefined scent when movement is detected.  
- **LED Feedback System**:  
  - **White**: Motion detected.  
  - **Green**: Signal successfully sent.  
  - **Red**: Error in scent dispersal.  
  - **Partnerâ€™s Color (e.g., Blue/Purple)**: Scent successfully released.  

## Hardware Components  
We built ScentConnect using the following components:  
- **Raspberry Pi Pico W** (for Wi-Fi communication)  
- **HC-SR04 Distance Sensor** (to detect movement)  
- **L293D Motor Driver** (to control the scent dispenser)  
- **DC Motor** (reverse-engineered from a battery-operated air freshener)  
- **RGB LED** (to indicate system states)  
- **Red LED** (indicates device power status)  
- **Switch** (to turn the device on/off)  

## Reverse Engineering Air Fresheners  
ScentConnect was developed by reverse-engineering a commercial air freshener that operates on a timed interval. The circuit and logic behind its motor operation were analyzed and adapted to allow wireless, motion-triggered scent release. This approach also enables possible integration with **smart home systems**.  

## Software Overview  
The software consists of two main scripts:  

### `access_point.py` (Pico A)  

### `station.py` (Pico B)  

### Communication Mechanism  
The devices communicate via **UDP broadcasting** on a local Wi-Fi network

## Installation & Setup  
1. **Flash the firmware** onto both Raspberry Pi Pico W devices.  
2. **Upload `access_point.py` to Pico A** (acts as the Wi-Fi host).  
3. **Upload `station.py` to Pico B** (connects as a client).  
4. **Assemble hardware** as per the circuit diagram.  
5. **Power the devices on** and enjoy the scent-triggered connection!
